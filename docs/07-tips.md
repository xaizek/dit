TIPS
====

Install and use bash completion
-------------------------------

Bash completion script is installed in standard location and should work
automatically.  Lots of things are completed in a predictable and helpful
manner, so be sure to use the completion as it helps a great deal.

Create aliases for frequently used projects
-------------------------------------------

Example:

```bash
alias d.d='dit .dit'
alias d.v='dit .vifm'
```

Using dot as a separated might be better for using `Ctrl-W` with shell
configuration that stops at a dot.

Creating an alias for `dit` itself won't hurt either:

```bash
alias d='dit'
```
